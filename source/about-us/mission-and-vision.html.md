**Our mission today is to turn technology into a competitive advantage for category-defining
eCommerce brands**. We help our partners succeed by using technology as a source of leverage and
differentiation.

We pursue and get better at our mission every day by constantly optimizing our practices and by
creating a reinforcing loop between the problems we solve for our partners and [the products we
build to solve them.](/about-us/what-we-do/#we-build-an-ecommerce-framework)

**Our long-term vision is to become the world's leading engineering agency for eCommerce brands with
unique technical challenges.** We want Nebulab to be the most respected eCommerce firm in the world
and to create a global, lasting and positive impact on our industry.

We will achieve this impact by developing a crystal-clear understanding of the different trends,
stakeholders and motivations that drive our industry, and building know-how and technical solutions
for the eCommerce disruptors of our age.
