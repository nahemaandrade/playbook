title: The Nebulab Playbook
---

Hello! We are [Nebulab](https://nebulab.com), a full-service eCommerce agency. We specialize in
building bespoke eCommerce experiences for disruptive brands. We also lead the development of
[Solidus](https://solidus.io), the open-source eCommerce platform for industry trailblazers.

If you're here, it means you already work at Nebulab (yay!), or you're interested in working _at_
Nebulab, or you're interested in working _with_ Nebulab, or you just want to take a sneak peek
at how we do things over here. Or maybe you rage-clicked a SERP and ended up on this site. Whatever
the case might be, let us first give you the history and tour of this playbook, so that you can more
easily find your way around.

## About this playbook

We were born in 2011, and we've been remote-first since day 1—this playbook, which used to be a
humble GitHub Wiki, was one of our very first company-wide initiatives. In these 10+ years, the
playbook has changed shape more than once, but our vision for it has always stayed the same: to
document both the kind of company we are creating and the kind of change we are effecting.

If you've read a company playbook before, this will be no different. Inside, you can expect to read
a combination of strategic thoughts about our culture and tactical information about our rituals.
Basically, we use this as a repository for all company-wide ideas that we think are worth sharing
with the outside world.

## How to read this playbook

The playbook is divided into sections (e.g., "Managing teams") which themselves are divided into
chapters (e.g., "Leading engagements"). Each section explores one aspect of life at Nebulab, while
each chapter explores a specific… well, aspect of that aspect.

If this playbook was a real book made of real paper, you could read the playbook cover-to-cover, or
you could jump between chapters/sections as needed—whatever floats your boat. Since this playbook
is most definitely not made of real paper (unless you print it, but think of the trees!), just
feel free to click around as much as you want.

Oh, did we mention the playbook [is on GitHub](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook)? Because the
content changes fairly often, we recommend using the [list of commits](https://github.com/nebulab/playbook/commits/master)
as a changelog to make sure you don't miss anything important—especially if you're an employee!

If you're still reading, we like you already. Dive right in!
