title: Holding 1:1s
---

All Engineering Managers are expected to have recurring 1:1 meetings (one-on-ones) with their team.
These meetings are typically held every two weeks and they are 30-minutes long, although the
frequency and length are decided with the report. Both parties should equally contribute to the
agenda, which may or may not have fixed sections and discussion points.

Thanks to their flexibility, 1:1s are possibly the most valuable tool at a manager's disposal. They
create a fixed cadence through which you can carry out a lot of your responsibilities, such as:

- Gauging the teammate's morale and overall satisfaction with Nebulab.
- Supporting the teammate in their personal and professional growth.
- Providing and receiving positive and constructive feedback.
- Keeping your teammate in the loop about what's going on in the company.
- Having performance and compensation-related conversations.

No matter your workload and priorities, 1:1s should be considered a sacred ritual. It's okay to
reschedule a 1:1 every once in a while if absolutely needed—it's NOT okay to skip them.

## What makes a great 1:1

When it comes to 1:1s, there is no right way to do them: every teammate has their communication
style and preferences. The secret to a great 1:1 is understanding what your report is interested in
discussing, and adapting your management style to it. At the same time, you don't want to come
across as fake, so make sure you bring your whole self to the 1:1 as well.

Here are some ground rules to follow for holding effective 1:1s:

- **Prepare thoroughly.** Don't jump into a 1:1 with no idea of what you're going to discuss. Review
  the agenda from the past meeting and use it to prepare the new one. Make sure to always ask your
  report if they have any points _they_ would like to discuss!
- **Show genuine interest.** Your main job during a 1:1 is to build trust and rapport, so that the
  other person is comfortable telling you what's really on their mind, rather than what they think
  you want to hear. The only way to build rapport is to show genuine interest in them.
- **Build accountability.** The only thing worse than not holding 1:1s is holding useless 1:1s,
  where it feels like you're both wasting your time. To make your 1:1s useful, build
  accountability: have clear action items for each meeting and follow up on them as quickly as
  possible.

One more tip: it can be tempting to schedule all your 1:1s on the same day, so that the rest of your
week is free to do other work. However, 1:1s are very demanding—it is hard to effectively do more
than one or two a day. Instead, try to distribute them evenly, so that you can give each 1:1 the
attention it deserves.

## What to discuss in 1:1s

In the introduction to this chapter, we hinted briefly at what's typically discussed during 1:1
meetings. For most reports, 1:1s will be a place to discuss how things are going on a personal and
professional level, to provide and gather feedback about their performance and yours, to
[promote their growth](/managing-teams/coaching-reports/), to keep them informed and collect
feedback about any new company-wide initiatives.

Just like every teammate has their own communication style, they also have different topics they
want to discuss in their 1:1s. The agenda for your 1:1s should be equally shared between you and
your report—if something's on their mind, they should be able to talk about it.

One somewhat sensitive topic is how much of their personal life someone should share during a 1:1.
As a manager, talking about personal matters during 1:1s can be beneficial for two reasons:

1. Knowing what's going on _outside_ of work gives both you and your report context and perspective
   about what happens _at_ work (e.g. if someone's going through a hard time in their personal life,
   that might explain why they're underperforming).
2. Sharing stories is one of the best ways to establish a foundation of trust, show vulnerability
   and build rapport. It shows your report that you're human and fallible, and it reassures them
   that it's okay to be a real person at work.

On the other hand, work is work, and everyone should respect the privacy of their colleagues. One
tried and true approach at Nebulab is to set clear expectations during the first 1:1 about how much
of your personal life you're both comfortable sharing—once some ground rules have been put in place,
it becomes much easier to speak freely while also respecting each other's boundaries.
