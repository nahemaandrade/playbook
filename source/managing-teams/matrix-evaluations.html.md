title: Matrix evaluations
---

Engineering managers at Nebulab are responsible for periodically evaluating their reports on our
[Competency Matrix](/personal-growth/competency-matrix/). This can be a daunting task the first
time, as the matrix is fairly large and much of it is open to interpretation (by design). This
guide is aimed at equipping you with some basic knowledge that will make matrix evaluations (also
called "check-ins") a bit less intimidating.

We commit to holding formal evaluations at least once a yearâ€”in reality, most managers at Nebulab
will evaluate their reports every six months. Six months is long enough to see some real progress
since the last evaluation, but short enough to provide constant, actionable feedback.

## Initiating an evaluation

While managers have the last word on their outcome, matrix evaluations are initiated by the report.
This is because **we want growth to be a bottom-up responsibility at Nebulab**, rather than
something that's imposed by upper management. Allowing everyone to initiate their evaluation gives
people control over their own growth path, and is appreciated at all levels of the organization.

One aspect of confusion is whether people should evaluate against their current position or the
next one in the matrix (e.g., should an IC2 Software Engineer evaluate against IC2 or IC3?). There's
no clear-cut answer here, and you may typically encounter a couple of different scenarios:

- If your report is  still working on critical areas for their current position (which is often the
  case with juniors, for example), there's no point in overwhelming them with an even more demanding
  evaluation.
- If, on the other hand, they're mostly aligned with their current position, you should encourage
  them to evaluate against the next position, so that they can start working on the skills that will
  lead them to a promotion.

The rule of thumb is that the matrix should be used as a tool to coach your report. Before
initiating an evaluation, you should always discuss this aspect with your report and use your best
judgment to give a recommendation.

## Filling your side of the evaluation

> **Pro Tip:** During your evaluation, you will be able to see the answers left by your report. We
> recommend only doing this after you've left your own evaluation for each skill, in order to
> minimize bias during the process.

Once one of your reports has initiated and completed
[their side of an evaluation](/personal-growth/competency-matrix), you'll get an email notification
and you'll be able to provide your input.

For each skill, you can enter whether the person is working towards, meeting exceeding the
expectations. You will also be able to leave some free-form feedback for each skill. This is
strongly encouraged for anything other than a "meeting expectations": if your report is
under-performing or over-performing, they should know what they could improve/what they're doing
well!

Once you've evaluated all skills, you can submit the evaluation. This will notify your report and
allow you to complete the joint review.

## Reviewing the evaluation together

The last step in the matrix evaluation process is the joint review. You and your report should meet
(this usually happens during a longer-than-usual 1:1), review your answers together and resolve any
discrepancies.

As you may imagine, the joint review can sometimes lead to pleasant surprises (e.g., if your report
has evaluated themselves lower than you have), but it can also be an uncomfortable process (if the
opposite has happened).

You should go skill-by-skill and listen to your report's point of view thoroughly. If you think they
have a point, feel free to change your evaluation accordingly, but remember that the matrix is a
tool for growth, and you're not doing anyone a favor by being overly permissive in your evaluation.
Whatever you do, make sure to explain your thought process clearly and transparently at every step
of the way, to reassure the other person you have their best interests at heart.

The final step of the evaluation is leaving some general feedback on the report. This can be a
powerful tool for giving them a high-level direction until the next evaluation, so take your time
and use it wisely!

## Recommending a promotion

Sometimes, once you've completed the evaluation, you'll realize that your report is ready to be
promoted to a more senior position. We don't have algorithms for determining when people should be
promoted: we always require them to be _mostly_ aligned with the competency matrix for their new
title, but managers have some flexibility in deciding whether to give out a promotion a bit ahead of
time.

The rationale for this flexibility is that some skills on the competency matrix can be especially
hard to master, and we don't want them to impede people's overall career progression if they're
performing well. If you're unsure, look at the high-level description for the new title in
Progression: does it seem like the person is aligned with the described seniority, scope, impact and
responsibilities?

If you've decided to promote your report, you should submit your request to a Director. Once the
request is approved, you can update the person's title in Progression and celebrate the event in
the `#shoutouts` channel on Slack!

Note that, when your report gets a promotion, their salary will be adjusted during the next
[compensation review][compensation-review].
